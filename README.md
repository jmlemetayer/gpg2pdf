# OpenPGP to QR code converter

Printing your secret keys or revocation certificates on paper is a good idea to
achieve long-term storage. This can be done by printing the ASCII version or by
using [paperkey].

Recovery is another problem and can be difficult when using raw text files. The
use of QR codes is particularly effective in dealing with this issue.

## Disclaimer and dependencies

The tools has been developed and tested on debian 9 only. Some packages are
needed:

```
% apt install coreutils gawk gnupg imagemagick paperkey qrencode zbar-tools
```

## Usage

The `gpg2qr` tool generate a _ready to print_ document using QR codes. It can
handle both secret keys and revocation certificates.

```
% gpg2qr -i secret.(asc|gpg) -o secret.(pdf|png|...)
```

---

The `qr2gpg` tool read documents generated by `gpg2qr` and reconstruct the
secret data. It is also able to handle both secret keys and revocation
certificates. Note that, when using secret keys, the associated public key
have to be given.

```
% qr2gpg -i secret.(pdf|png|...) -o secret.gpg [ -p public.(asc|gpg) ]
```

---

Both tools are able to read and write from standard input / output and can be
used in piped commands.

```
% gpg --export-secret-key <key id> | gpg2qr | lpr
```

```
% scanimage | qr2gpg [ -p public.(asc|gpg) ] | gpg --import
```
